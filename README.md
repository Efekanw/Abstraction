# Abstraction
Abstraction is a tool for abstracting Python source codes for artificial intelligence. In this way, abstraction reduces the size of the dictionary to be given to the RNN model. Currently tool can abstract 'Methods, variables, attributes, annotations, dictionaries, lists, exceptions, constants'.
The abstraction process is performed using the python parser. In this way, it returns successful results for all python codes.
